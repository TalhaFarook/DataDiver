David Kelly,"I am shockingly, comically bad at golf. However, that doesn’t stop me from occasionally watching more gifted souls play the game. One of their techniques is to examine a putt from multiple perspectives. They take a careful look at the green as they come up to mark their ball, look at the putt from the side, squat down to consider it from the opposite direction, and generally scout out the lay of the land from all angles. For myself, since I’m generally wielding the putter playing my seventh or eighth, I don’t further test the patience of my companions with such preparations. However, I will admit that, for the average golfer, looking at a putt from multiple angles yields useful information.A similar rationale can be applied to monetary policy decisions. Changes in monetary policy are among the most important drivers of stock and bond returns. Consequently, one of the questions we are asked most frequently is where will the federal funds rate be at the end of the year?Read the full article for my latest insights. #markets #economy #investing"

Olivia Leal-Walker,"It is no surprise that Sustainability Manager comes in at number 9 on this list. Organisations are increasingly identifying the need to prioritise sustainability and ESG, and the amount of work that is required to action the commitments that they make. I am so fortunate to spend my days at SunRice Group improving the lives of others, spending every day living by my values.Sustainability Managers are responsible for shifting the attitudes and actions of an organisation so that it can create focused, meaningful societal benefit while providing value for customers and shareholders. In its most basic form, it is about doing less bad and more good.  By working in-house, it enables the space to build genuine relationships with the people within an organisation, to understand their drivers and those of the business, and to design and implement programs that solve for those needs. Creating a cultural shift over time that genuinely embeds sustainability into all decision-making is the end goal. You can bring value to this role regardless of your passion, your strengths and your style. There are Sustainability Manager positions suitable for those who are analytical, like change management, enjoy report writing, have a vision they want to deliver, and especially for those who just like to get on with the job.You can specialise in any field across the environment, social or governance spheres, or you can be a generalist. There are roles in corporate, government and not-for-profits. If you are looking to move into a Sustainability Manager position, I advise that you look to grow your skills by volunteering in your local community (a university qualification is also generally required). Regardless, this role universally requires adaptability and grit. Finally, you do not need to be a Sustainability Manager to create change in your organisation. Find something that you can do in your role today to improve lives, protect the environment and improve the customer experience today.__I am delighted to have been asked to share my perspective on being a Sustainability Manager by Cathy Anderson. If you are interested in this career and would like to know more about how you can bring your individual strengths and passions, please do reach out."
Lorenzo Simonelli,"Three months ago, Baker Hughes convened 1,600+ customers and partners at our Annual Meeting in Italy to discuss the balance of the energy trilemma and the momentum needed to advance towards a net-zero emissions future. In my keynote, I shared the results from our Energy Transition Pulse report, conducted in partnership with FT Longitude, which revealed the #1 most important activity to drive sustainable and affordable energy will be to continue investments in lower carbon energy sources: https://lnkd.in/g_m28Vud These lower carbon energy sources include hydrogen - an addressable market as much as $30 billion by 2030 for Baker Hughes. I am encouraged to see other leaders support the hydrogen economy, too, since it takes all of us to address climate change. Leaders like my friend Arnaud Pieton of Technip Energies are carrying the hydrogen economy forward. I encourage my network to read his note below on hydrogen’s necessity for investment in Europe, to balance wind and sun while also maintaining affordable energy. It is a great reminder that the energy industry continues to be the driver of emissions reduction if we align together, share a singular vision for the future, and take action every day. As Arnaud says, “We know what this new world looks like. We now need to invent, scale up and deploy its solutions.” For my network, how else can we deploy hydrogen technologies faster?#hydrogen #EnergyTechnology #Netzero2050 #BHAM23"

Laiba Shabbir,"As I'm a technical content writer I have written number of blogs about solutions and issues of system.There was a hard disk not found error on my laptop and I rushed to the shop and asked a shopkeeper to fix it. I told him hard disk is kinda mismanaged. He looked towards my face and suspected me as a stupid girl. First he touched my laptop with dirty hands( he was doing some painting work).Then he said leave it here and come back at night to have it back.He wasn't just playing with my emotions but driving me crazy doing tantrums. Secondly he made a statement this laptop doesn't have a  hard drive, how are you so sure if it's the issue.At the very moment I decided to fix my laptop myself. I asked I do not have screw driver would you please give it to me. I will fix it myself. He replied ohh! how can you do it. Are you sure you can do it. (He gave me screw driver)I fixed my laptop in front of him. And showed him how things work out.Laiba RockedTechnician ShockedI realized everybody should have proper information about fixing these little things otherwise people can misguide you and you can be in great loss.

I reached in Emergency Department within 15 minutes, the time I faced hell heat when Nurse told me ""we received him dead "" حسرتیں خاک ہوئیں، مٹ گئے ارماں سارے...دیکھتے رہ گئے ہم ، ہاتھ سے جانا دل کا.Mehroz was on the stretcher His eyes was open and looking me and saying good bye Abu..No.. Never ..you are with me ever all time...you are my soul ..in my heart..  My mind still talks you..my heart feels you..I know you are in peace..your each every moments passed with me is unforgettable .وقت نے ختم کردیئے سارے وسیلے شوق کےدل تھا، اُلٹ پلٹ گیا۔ آنکھ تھی، بُجھ بُجھا گئیAll time I see and feel him in my hug, on my shoulder, in my bed, in my arms, on the stretcher, in the cuffin.Its worst feeling like a hell to see your young son buried, the pain of losing child is unimaginable, Even today it’s difficult to me to accept that he is gone .وہ آئے اور گئے بھی ، نظر میں اب تک سما رہے ہیں۔یہ چل رہے ہیں، وہ پھر رہے ہیں، یہ آ رہے ہیں، وہ جا رہے ہیں Please do recite Fateha for him and pray for me and my family to bear this un- recoverable loss.مٹا سکے گی اُسے ، گردِ ماہ و سال کہاں کھنچی ھُوئی ھے ، جو تصویر یار آنکھوں میں.(‏جو اللہ کی رضا)"

It also includes a number-guessing game and two practice question papers I wrote in preparation for my semester exams.<- These problems are designed to help anyone who wants to learn C programming or improve their skills in the language, and I am confident that this practice set will be a valuable resource for students, beginners, and even experienced programmers who are looking to refresh their skills. It is a great way to challenge yourself and enhance your understanding of the C language.So if you're interested in improving your C programming skills, head over to my GitHub account and check out the practice set.

Molly E.,"If you have people in your team who have kids, please keep following in mind:- There maybe days when they didn't sleep properly because their baby couldn't sleep. Be kind and if they want to join late, let them. - They might need to give daily pick and drop to the school going kids because they can't afford drivers/can't trust third party services. Please support them. - Extend Maternity & Paternity Leaves and don't think it is a party time. Discourage people who joke about it. It is toughest time of a life because parents have to look after a little baby who is completely dependent on them for survival. Minimum 6 months paid maternity leaves should be mandatory, as baby cannot even start solid foods before that. (If you are offering less than 6 months leave, pls do a survey how many women leave jobs post maternity in your company). - The working mother might need to feed her baby every 2-3 hours if the baby is under 2 years. Please provide ""proper"" day care facility and support. (So many girls come to me in mental stress regarding how they have to leave their baby behind because the company doesn't have daycare - how can companies even expect this? Its ruthless)- Develop a thriving hybrid culture. Provide flexibility wherever you can. Covid has proved that a lot of jobs can be done much better when working from home. Also offer flexibility in working hours whenever required. Focus on results. -----------------------------------------------------I have said it before and I'll say it again: Empathy is everything. You never know what a person in your team is going through. Life is not easy and this is the least we can do as a leader. Take care of your people. I am lucky to be working for an organization that focuses on everything mentioned above, and more. I hope everyone starts thinking about it and make a positive impact in this world! #workingparents #worklifebalance #empathy #compassion #workingmoms #workingmom #maternitycare #paternityleave #flexibility #hybridwork #leadership"

Tonja Bell,"I am very pleased to know, the UNDP’s fresh report is out on ‘Promoting Women Entrepreneurs as Driver of Business Integrity: A Practical Approach.’  https://lnkd.in/dQ-Th3w2 The report highlights the importance of women’s empowerment, the link between entrepreneurship, equal opportunities and business integrity, and how women entrepreneurs can transform the narrative from ""victim"" to ""drivers of change"" in business and society.I personally feel this report will work on various levels as a solution-driven measure. It investigates frameworks related to gender equality, especially on enabling and inclusive workplace policies and laws; on the other hand, it looks at anti-corruption measures and institutions that promote a fair and transparent business environment. Being an advocate of ethical practices, responsible business and conduct, I strongly urge every organization, big or small, without sector specification to use this report as a tool to ‘drive’ a new narrative about the role women entrepreneurs and women-led businesses can play in fostering fair business practices.A job well done by Brook Horowitz, IBLF Global and UNDP.

Usman Mansoor,"SCAM ALERT!! Careem should look into this asap!Today, I took my mother to NMC for her bi-monthly checkup and because she had chest infection, Doctor advised some emergency treatment after which she felt a bit of dizziness and that's the reason I booked a careem ride for her so she can comfortably reach home. We went to NMC through Bike but I had to go to the office directly so I preferred Careem (SEEMS TO BE THE BIGGEST EVER MISTAKE) from the national medical center around 6:56 PM to my destination: Saima Arabian Villas, with the Driver name Muhammad R. Driving a light Blue/Pearl color MIra with the REG NO: BMM 986. The estimated fare was around 1250 PKR. I asked the driver to start the ride and then I closed the door and putting my phone aside, I ran towards my bike because I was getting late and never checked the phone again until I reach to the office, My mother is not Tech-savy, After she reached home, She called me and told me that the fare she paid was 2500 PKR, I asked her why? She said the driver told me about this. Keeping her on the phone call I quickly checked my ride history and found that the ride was never started and even it was Cancelled. I immediately called the driver to make sure if this is true or not, I thought this is a bug from the app, The driver said I have a screenshot, That's where I felt something Fishy and I asked him to send over the screenshot over WhatsApp or else I will report this to customer care and you can see the attached Fake screenshot that he sent me thinking that I am dumb! I immediately call the support staff of careem and instead of asking for my money I requested them to block the driver from the app as he is scamming the customer instead of taking the side of the customer they were only telling me that we have reported the driver instead of the disclosing what action they took they told me that this can't be disclosed.LOOKS LIKE Careem INTENTIONALLY HIRES THESE TYPE OF SCAMMERS AND TAKE COMMISSIONS FROM THEM!Careem You may be good at viral marketing but pathetic when it comes to providing your customer necessary support when needed. I would encourage my relatives, friends and each and everyone I know and will know to stop using SHITTY careem and use alternative ride-hailing applications. These days you will find a bunch of scammers on the application supported by careem itself. All the screenshots are attached as proof along with the driver's image. Even the driver was using someone's else ID. This is honestly very ALARMING to put the security of the customers at RISK!Everyone, please advise what necessary action I can take, I know it's just 2500 PKR but I won't stop here until the driver is banned permanently and I see a proof of it!!#karachi #Careem #Scammers #security"
Afrika Dan Nkambule,"9 years ago, I got an opportunity to lead the audit fieldwork at Abbott Diabetes Care, EY had recently won the audit of Abbott group from Deloitte and I had recently joined EY then in their Reading office in UK. Being part of a US listed business, Abbott Diabetes Care had to comply with SOX. This was my first flavor of SOX, internal controls and corporate governance and I knew I had found my calling! Over the years, I have set up internal controls functions, advised companies on best in class processes and have managed risk mitigation when controls have failed! If you haven't heard of SOX before: Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (better known as SOX) was enacted in response to the accounting scandals of the early 2000s, and it sets strict standards for financial reporting and internal controls. It was put in place after the place after the dot-com bubble burst and the high-profile accounting scandals involving companies such as Enron and WorldCom were uncovered.I am a strong believer that great corporate governance and robust controls are not just pretty words on an annual return or investor deck, but if implemented properly, an effective control environment can enable companies of all sizes and maturity to build a resilient business, mitigate key risks and improve decisions.  Sure, controls & top notch corporate governance requires immense  investment, time and effort from top management to the junior team members and in pressed times of competing priorities, it is only natural to delay or de-prioritize anything which is not seen directly contributing to the growth of the business. However putting in a strong foundation today will enable you to build that shining gleaming ivory tower which you are striving towards every day. I have witnessed first hand over the past few years with various businesses which had focused on growth and acceleration at the expense of robust governance and ultimately collapsing like a house of cards! One of the most recent and extremely public collapse of FTX. Amongst many failings, one of the biggest was a complete lack of corporate governance. John J. Ray the new CEO of FTX said in a court filing ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls"" My personal stance on internal controls, risk management and corporate governance is that it should NOT be done to prevent catastrophes from happening (preventing negative outcomes), but rather CXOs should prioritize corporate governance as a mechanism of competitive advantage, strong business foundations and ultimately as a key driver complimenting growth (enabling positive outcomes). To all start up founders and SME business leaders, if you are looking to understand your business risks better and to put in place the necessary governance in place, lets connect to explore how we can collaborate to enable Transparency, Accountability and better Decision making frameworks for your business.#riskmanagement #startup #opportunity #growth"
